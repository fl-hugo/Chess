# How Play ? 🔨

Chess is a strategic board game that pits two players against each other on a 64-square board of alternating light and dark colors. Each player controls an army of 16 pieces, each with its own movement rules.
The aim of the game is to put the opponent's king in checkmate, which means that he is inevitably attacked and can no longer escape capture. This marks the end of the game and the victory of the attacking player.
